# Q-Repo: AI courses Repository

**A community-curated repository of free and high quality Artificial Intelligence courses from leading institutions worldwide.**

---

## 📋 Repository Overview

This project serves as a structured, centralized knowledge base for **AI education**. It categorizes hundreds of free courses, tracks their stability, and provides direct access to learning materials from universities, tech companies, and online platforms. **This project is part of Q-Repo, a huge repository of free online courses for everyone. Hosted by the Quantum CyberSec Community**

## 🎓 Featured Course Picks by Level

Based on community feedback and our own experience, here are our recommended starting points. If these don't suit your needs, explore the [Dynamic Institutions](/institutions/dynamic) to search through vast, updated catalogs.

| Level | Course | Institution | Direct Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | Elements of AI | University of Helsinki | [Link](/institutions/stable/university-helsinki.md) |
| **Beginner** | Machine Learning Crash Course | Google Developers | [Link](/institutions/stable/google.md) |
| **Intermediate** | Intro to Deep Learning | Kaggle | [Link](/institutions/stable/kaggle.md) |
| **Intermediate** | PRDV430: AI for Business Applications | Saylor Academy | [Link](/institutions/stable/saylor-academy.md) |
| **Advanced** | Diffusion Models Course | Hugging Face | [Link](/institutions/stable/huggingface.md) |
| **Advanced** | Practical Computer Vision with PyTorch | OpenHPI | [Link](/institutions/stable/openhpi.md) |
| **Expert** | Machine Learning with Python | freeCodeCamp | [Link](/institutions/stable/freecodecamp.md) |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories that classify courses by their **source** and by their **subject**.

### 1.  `/institutions` – Courses by Source
This directory organizes courses based on where they come from and how often they are updated.

####  **`/institutions/stable`**
Contains courses with **fixed, reliable links** that rarely change. These are perfect for structured learning paths.
- Each file corresponds to one institution (`google.md`, `university-helsinki.md`)
- Contains a complete, manually verified list of that institution's AI/ML courses
- All links are expected to remain valid long-term

####  **`/institutions/dynamic`**
Contains portals to institutions with **large, frequently updated** course catalogs where maintaining individual links is impractical.
- Each file is a portal to an institution's main course directory (`udacity.md`)
- Provides search strategies and keywords to find relevant courses
- Examples: Udacity, Microsoft Learn, Deeplearning.ai

### 2.  `/categories` – Courses by Topic
This directory organizes all courses (from both stable and dynamic institutions) by subject matter. Each file aggregates links for a specific field of study.

| Category File | Description | Example Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ai-fundamentals-ethics.md` | Foundational concepts, history, and ethical considerations | AI ethics, responsible AI, AI history, societal impact |
| `deep-learning.md` | Advanced neural architectures and applications | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, Computer Vision, NLP |
| `generative-ai.md` | Content generation and large language models | GPT models, Diffusion models, LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering |
| `machine-learning.md` | Traditional and applied machine learning | Supervised/unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering |
| `tools-frameworks.md` | Development tools, deployment, and MLOps | PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLflow, Kubernetes, cloud platforms |

**How it works**: Each category file contains:
- A table of **stable courses** specifically on that topic.
- References to **dynamic institutions** that offer courses in that category.
- Recommended learning paths and prerequisite guidance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is a **community-curated collection** and is provided for informational purposes only.

*   **Accuracy Not Guaranteed**: While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee that all information, links, or course details are current, correct, or complete. Institutions may update, move, or retire content without notice.
*   **Third-Party Content**: All courses and linked materials are the property of their respective institutions. This repository does not host any content itself; it only provides references, learning paths and links.
*   **Dynamic Changes**: Links in the `dynamic` institution portals are especially prone to change as platforms update their catalogs.
*   **User Verification**: We encourage users to verify course details, such as availability, pricing, and requirements, directly on the official provider's website before enrolling to any course.
